Here are some past projects we've worked on that might help you get a better idea of what it means to work as a Rails Engineer at FetLife:

    Implemented a profile verification system from the ground up using government ID and/or pictures portraying a certain gesture
    Added discussion pre-moderation for groups
    Added support for installing FetLife as a Progressive Web App
    Improved the efficiency of our Activity Feed Deliveries by splitting longer feed event deliveries into smaller async jobs and prioritizing delivery to more recently active members
    Introduced the possibility of tagging other members in pictures, videos, and writings
    Added powerful filtering to our on-site reporting system using ElasticSearch
    Improved location privacy for all our members by introducing granular location privacy settings
    Integrate Machine Learning solutions to detect age or potentially illegal content
